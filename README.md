## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a self-taught **Software Engineer** with nearly 3 years of professional experience in full-stack web development. My journey began with a Bachelor's degree in Physics, but my passion for technology and problem-solving led me to software development. I have a strong foundation in the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and **Django**, with additional expertise in **Linux**, **Docker**, and project deployment.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Computer Applications (MCA) to further enhance my technical knowledge.
